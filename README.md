Using a modified MelonLoader without some security features brings a risk with it, you should read Knah's blogpost: [Malicious Mods and you](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/edit/master/Malicious-Mods.md)

Don't blame me or other when you data or tokens get stolen. Always think about what mods you are using and why they are obfuscated and so on. 

Don't hatespeech the original Author please, without them this would not be possible!

## Info

This mod doesn't do anything on it's own.

It provides an easy way for modders to add integration with the action menu.

It supports the use of the

* Radial Puppet
* Four Axis Puppet
* Button
* Toggle Button
* Sub Menus

Additionally allows mods to add their menus to a dedicated section on the action menu to prevent clutter.

## Getting Started

To use simply add ActionMenuApi to your mods folder and reference it in your project same way as with UIX

### Building 

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gompocp/ActionMenuApi.git
   ```
2. Copy the .dlls from your MelonLoader\Managed folder to the Libs folder
3. Build Solution


## Usage

```cs
using ActionMenuApi.Api;
using ActionMenuApi.Pedals;
/*

Code

*/

//Call in OnApplicationStart()
//To add a button to the main page of the action menu
//                          Page to add to          Action for onClick                    Text       Texture     locked     
VRCActionMenuPage.AddButton(ActionMenuPage.Main, "Button",() => MelonLogger.Msg("Pressed Button"), buttonIcon true);

//To add a toggle to the main page of the action menu
VRCActionMenuPage.AddToggle(ActionMenuPage.Main,"Toggle", testBool, b => testBool = b, toggleIcon);

//To add a radial pedal to the main page of the action menu
VRCActionMenuPage.AddRadialPuppet(ActionMenuPageType.Main, "Radial",f => testFloatValue = f, testFloatValue, radialIcon);

//To add a submenu to the main page of the action menu and add a toggle and button to it
VRCActionMenuPage.AddSubMenu(ActionMenuPageType.Main, 
    "Sub Menu",
    delegate {
        MelonLogger.Msg("Sub Menu Opened");
        CustomSubMenu.AddButton("Pressed Button In Sub Menu", () => MelonLogger.Msg("Pressed Button In Sub Menu"), buttonIcon);
        CustomSubMenu.AddToggle("Sub Menu Toggle",testBool2, b => testBool2 = b, toggleIcon);
    },
    subMenuIcon
);
```

When you lock/update a pedal in anyway, you must call either `AMUtils.ResetMenu()` or `AMUtils.RefreshMenu()` so that these changes will be visible. If you are after locking a submenu its advised that you call `AMUtils.ResetMenu()` so that in case the user is already in the submenu it'll pushed them out of it. If you are just locking a button pedal or something, you can just call `AMUtils.RefreshMenu()` to rebuild the current action menu submenu. 

> NOTE FOR PEOPLE USING THE LOCKING FUNCTIONALITY FOR RISKY FUNCTIONS: It is advised that in the case that my reflection to reset/refresh the action menu fails you have a boolean check in the pedal trigger event so that the action can't run anyway if it fails
